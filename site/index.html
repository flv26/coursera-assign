                    </div>
                    <p>

                        <h3>Escargots</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The garlicky sauce in this dish is almost as delicious as the escargots themselves; it's hard to think of a better use for crusty bread than sopping up this luxurious "snail butter." But the main event is the escargots' tender texture and clean, woodsy
                        flavor. When we ran this recipe in 1949, it took a full day's work, most of it cleaning and prepping the fresh snails. We found that canned snails work just as well and turn this appetizer into one that can be whipped up anytime.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Yummy. You see bat soup is so delicious that not only makes you drool but even causes side efffects like sleeping for days and just dreaming about it while suffocating on your own saliva , and hoping to be still alive just to have another one :D Don't
