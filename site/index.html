                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The garlicky sauce in this dish is almost as delicious as the escargots themselves; it's hard to think of a better use for crusty bread than sopping up this luxurious "snail butter." But the main event is the escargots' tender texture and clean, woodsy
                        flavor. When we ran this recipe in 1949, it took a full day's work, most of it cleaning and prepping the fresh snails. If there is a copyright infringement notice for the recipe .. You don't know me
